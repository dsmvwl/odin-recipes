# odin-recipes
This is a project intended to allow me to demonstrate what I've learned so far through the Odin Project. I will namely be demonstrating my ability to create a repo on GitHub, move the repo to my local machine, create my webpage which will outline some recipes, and commit it all back to GitHub.
