    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bubble tea is a tea-based drink that originated in Taiwan in the early 1980s. It most commonly consists of tea accompanied by chewy tapioca balls ("boba" or "pearls"), but it can be made with other toppings as well.
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
<li>Â¾ cup water</li>
<li>3 tea bags</li>
<li>1 cup whole milk</li>
<li>2 tbsp heavy cream, optional but highly recommended!</li>
<li>sweetener of your choice</li>
<li>1 pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a sauce pan, bring water to a boil, add the tea bags and turn the heat to low. Make sure the tea bags are all submerged in water.</li>
            <li>Cook for one minute before adding milk. Stir and cook until the milk tea is steaming, yet not boiling (about one to two minutes).</li>
            <li>Remove the tea bags, add heavy cream and sweetener of your choice with a small pinch of salt. Pour into your cup and enjoy!</li>
            <li>If you want to make iced milk tea, let it cool down and add some ice cubes or simply chill it in the fridge for few hours to avoid diluting your milk tea.</li>
        </ol>
