    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. bag of glutinous rice flour</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. oil</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups filtered water</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the water and brown sugar until fully mixed.  Let cool to about room temperature.  Do not use until it's cooled or else you'll end up cooking the rice flour mixture (instead of steaming it).</li>
            <li>Steam the batter for 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the cakes cool on your countertop for about 2 hours, then remove from the moulds & store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours.  It's best if you plan to store it overnight in the fridge, that way you're not impatiently waiting around for it to cool.</li>
            <li>Slice the cakes, coat with egg and lightly pan fry on medium-low heat for about 3 min. on each side or until it's soft and gooey.</li>
        </ol>
